Great question — here’s a detailed list of where you can get high-quality African financial and economic data, broken down by type and source.

📊 Where to Get African Financial & Economic Data
1. Stock Exchange Websites (Public HTML & PDF Scraping)
Exchange	Data Available	URL

Egyptian Exchange (EGX)	Quotes, financials, IPO data	https://www.egx.com.eg
Botswana Stock Exchange	Corporate news, dividend info	https://www.bse.co.bw

👉 How to collect:

Use Playwright or Puppeteer to render and scrape dynamic JavaScript pages.

Central Bank of Kenya	Rates, reports, FX	https://www.centralbank.go.ke
BCEAO (West Africa)	Regional data for 8 countries	https://www.bceao.int

TechCabal, BusinessDay NG, Moneyweb SA	Economic and market news
Reuters Africa, Bloomberg Africa	Higher-quality feeds (some paid)
AfricanBusiness.com	Features, sector outlooks

👉 Combine with NLP models (spaCy, Hugging Face, GPT) for sentiment extraction and classification.

6. Existing APIs / Datasets (Jumpstart)

Alpha Vantage / Twelve Data	Some African tickers	Limited coverage
Quandl (Refinitiv / FRED)	Macro data	Mostly paid
Yahoo Finance	Limited ticker data	Can be scraped

⚠️ Legal & Licensing Notes
Public scraping is often fine if it’s not copyrighted or behind a login.

Avoid scraping real-time prices unless you’re licensed — exchanges (like JSE) may enforce fees.

Always read the Terms of Service. For monetization, consider negotiating data partnerships or resell licenses down the line.
